# DaGameSolve 

### Package to find all equilibria to discrete-action, N-player games

**DaGameSolve**, in theory, is an all purpose for discrete action, $N$-player, simultaneous move games of complete information. In principle, it should completely solve any game, or sequence of games (as described in the documentation), meaning that it should generate all equilibria for the games.

The complication: **DaGameSolve** is slow.
